        <h3>Q1 - What is the significance of using semantic structural elements in HTML5? Provide three examples of such elements and describe their intended use.</h3>
        <p>
            Semantic structural elements in HTML5 are essential for creating well-structured, meaningful, and accessible web content. These elements provide a clearer understanding of the content's purpose and relationship within the document, both for human readers and assistive technologies.
            Three examples of semantic structural elements:
            <br>
            <b>Header -</b>  It represents a container for introductory content or a group of navigational elements. It typically appears at the top of a page or a section and contains information such as a site logo, site title, navigation menus, and other relevant content.
            <br>
            <b>Article -</b> It defines a self-contained composition that makes sense on its own. It represents content that could be distributed and reused independently, such as a blog post, news article, forum post, or a product review. This element helps search engines and screen readers identify and prioritize the main content of a page.
            <br>
            <b>Footer -</b> It represents the footer of a section or a page. It typically contains information about the author, copyright notices, contact details, related links, and other metadata. Placing this content within a element helps visually separate it from the main content and signifies the end of the content.
        </p>

        <h3>Q2 - Explain the purpose of the &ltheader&gt, &ltnav&gt, and &ltfooter&gt elements in HTML5. How do they contribute to creating a well-structured webpage? </h3>
        <p>
            <b>header -></b> This element represents the introductory content or the top section of a webpage. It typically includes elements such as the site title, logo, tagline, and primary navigation menus.
            <br>
            <b>nav -></b> element is used to define a section of navigation links. It's meant to contain a collection of links that help users navigate within the website or to other related pages.
            <br>
            <b>Footer -></b> element represents the bottom section of a webpage. It typically contains information such as copyright notices, contact details, related links, and other metadata.
            <br>
            This semantic structure enhances the user experience, accessibility, and search engine optimization, making the webpage easier to navigate and understand for all users, including those using assistive technologies.
        </p>

        <h3>Q3 - How does using semantic elements improve accessibility and SEO for web content? Give examples of how search engines and screen readers might interpret semantic elements differently.</h3>
        <p>
            Using semantic elements in web content significantly improves both accessibility and SEO (Search Engine Optimization). Let's explore how these elements benefit each aspect and provide examples of how search engines and screen readers interpret them differently:
            <br>
            <b>Accessibility:</b>

            Semantic elements improve accessibility by providing clear and meaningful structure to web content. This structure helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the organization of the page and present it effectively to users with disabilities.
            <br>
            <b>Example:</b>
            Consider a web page with an article. Using the &gtarticle&lt element to wrap the article's content indicates its main purpose. Screen readers can announce it as a standalone piece of content, allowing users to navigate directly to the article's content.
            <br><br>
            <b>SEO (Search Engine Optimization):</b>
            <br>
            Search engines strive to understand the content of web pages to deliver relevant search results. Semantic elements enhance this understanding by providing context and hierarchy to the content, thus improving a webpage's visibility in search engine results.
            <br>
            <b>Example:</b>
            Suppose you have a blog post on your website about "Healthy Breakfast Ideas." By using the &gtarticle&lt element to define the main content and the &gtheader&lt element to include the title, you signal to search engines that this section is a self-contained article with specific content. This can help the search engine rank your article higher in search results when users search for related keywords.
